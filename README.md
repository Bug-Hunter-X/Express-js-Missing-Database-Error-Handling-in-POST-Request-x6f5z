# Express.js Missing Database Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database operations.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/users` endpoint.  It receives user data, but lacks crucial error handling during database interactions.  If the database operation (e.g., insertion) fails, the server might crash or behave unexpectedly without providing any feedback to the client.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code.  It includes comprehensive error handling to catch database errors and provide appropriate responses to the client, ensuring robustness and graceful handling of failures.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the bug.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the solution.
6. Test with Postman or curl, simulating database errors (e.g., by intentionally causing a database connection failure).
